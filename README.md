# Settisizer

Run phpUnit tests with ../../../vendor/bin/phpunit

# Roadmap

## Next steps

 - Integrate publish function to write standard config file (to select different drivers)
 - Comment the whole thingy
 - Write a second driver (mysql, redis)
 - Facade to access global Settisizer with 

``` 
<?php
Settisizer::getSetting('setting_name')
```
